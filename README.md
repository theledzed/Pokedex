## POKEDEX APP

In this application I use pokeApi to show a minimalist list, each pokemon has a detail where you can see a graph of its stats, pokedex number, pokemon type, height and weight

## POKEAPI

To show the list of pokemon I use this API: https: //pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon

To show the detail of the pokemon I use this API https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{idPokemon}/
